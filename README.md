The Subdomain enumeration looks for subdomains under the domain you specify.
here I also provided one of the wordlists I would use to enumerate subdomains. 
You also need to specify what wordlist you wamt to use and remember to NOT use quotationmarks of any sort!


The webscraper is very simple to use, just enter the link to the website you want to scrape.
